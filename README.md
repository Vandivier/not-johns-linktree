# not-johns-linktree, a Social Home Template

Please use this repository [as a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to create your own social home site or portfolio website!

This social home site is [built using Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/gh-pages) and follows a simple but effective visual pattern inspired by [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/).

This social home site is made to deploy to GitHub Pages, a forever-free static site hosting service from GitHub!

View the live site [here](https://vandivier.github.io/not-johns-linktree/).

Very similar to [basic-nextjs-portfolio](https://github.com/Vandivier/basic-nextjs-portfolio), but with a few more bells and whistles related so social media. For example, this template uses [react-social-icons](https://github.com/jaketrent/react-social-icons).

## use

1. Install using `yarn` and run a local deployment server using `yarn start`.

2. Update the site as you see fit.

   1. I encourage you to edit a few design elements including the colors to fit your personal style.

   2. For most developers, I recommend that they retain a GitHub, LinkedIn, and Blog link in the portfolio.

   3. Update the social media icons appropriately, convieniently located within the `Socials.tsx` component.

3. Deploy to GitHub Pages using `yarn deploy`. Ensure your repository settings have GitHub Pages enabled to obtain a public URL.
