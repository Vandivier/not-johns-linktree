# basic-nextjs-portfolio

Please use this repository [as a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for your own portfolio!

This portfolio site is [built using Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/gh-pages) and follows a simple but effective visual pattern inspired by [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/).

This portfolio is made to deploy to GitHub Pages, a forever-free static site hosting service from GitHub!

View the live site [here](https://vandivier.github.io/basic-nextjs-portfolio/).

# use

1. Install using `npm i` and run a local deployment server using `npm start`.

2. Update the site as you see fit.

   1. I encourage you to edit a few design elements including the colors to fit your personal style.

   2. For most developers, I recommend that they retain a GitHub, LinkedIn, and Blog link.

3. Deploy to GitHub Pages using `npm run deploy`. Ensure your repository settings have GitHub Pages enabled to obtain a public URL.
